//primitive types : boolean, byte, char, short, int ,long, float, double
//objects - instance of a class (class the data type)

//statically typed = variables are given data types up front (before compiling)
//dynamically typed = variables do not have types. 

//data type = the type of the data. How the computer interprets the data

//literals - the value;
//variable - 

//argument: what you pass in to a method, when you call it
//parameter: the variable to store arguments, when you define it

//Static - you don't have to make an instance of something'
//variable - stores some value
//expression - evaluates to a value
//operator - work on operands to produce a value
//operand - the thing(s) the operator works on
